Notes:

This will be a blog page with counties I have been to. I will create additional functionality but it wont make it to production for this project. 

MVP Status

1) Models - 

Users - Setup users and login

Articles - Will contain the starter of the blog. I will probably focus completely on the blog aspect until that is setup and then move on from there. 

Add Modal, CSS, Music, and Background Image



Post MVP
1) API
    - Google Places API

2) I plan to have a basically create a travel search blog app. 

3) Favorites - I plan to have a favorites model where you can store the favorites of the specific user. The model will allow users to store their favorites in the app and use them.
